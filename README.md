# **Identification of fraudulent methods**

If there are the following characteristics, we will consider the video to be false:

1. Factual falsification:

It refers to fabricating false facts or information and disseminating them through video, text, or other media. This behavior not only misleads the public, but may also cause social panic and distrust.

Rumor mongers may intentionally create and disseminate false information for personal gain, political purposes, or other motives.

2. Video forgery:

By using techniques such as editing and synthesis, video clips from different times and locations are pieced together to create false event scenes.

These fake videos are often difficult for ordinary viewers to recognize because they appear very real, but in reality they are carefully designed scams.

3. Title induction:

Using exaggerated and provocative titles to attract the audience's attention, while the content does not match or is completely unrelated to the title.

This technique exploits people's psychology by creating curiosity or emotional reactions to increase click through rates and traffic.

4. Inconsistencies between graphics and text:

The content of a video or article is completely inconsistent with its title, images, or description, which is a deceptive way of disseminating information.

This technique is also aimed at attracting attention, but the information provided is vastly different from the audience's expectations, leading to misleading information.

5. Taking out of context:

Extract partial content from complete news events, ignore context and overall situation, and only select parts that can attract attention or conform to specific viewpoints for reporting.

This selective reporting approach often leads to public misunderstanding of events, as it deprives the event of its integrity and multidimensional perspectives.

6. Subjective speculation:

The author makes subjective assumptions and guesses about events based on personal biases or preconceived positions, rather than relying on facts and evidence.

This reporting method can easily lead to information distortion because it ignores objectivity and impartiality, only pursuing stories that conform to the author's viewpoint.

7. AI generation:

The videos or audio generated using artificial intelligence technology may appear or sound very realistic, but in reality, they are completely fictional.

The content generated by AI can mimic the words and actions of real people, creating false news or information. The development of this technology poses an increasing challenge to the authenticity of information.
